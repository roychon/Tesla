# Clone of Tesla Website (in process)

## A model of the Tesla Website created from scratch using HTML/CSS and Vanilla JS.

Welcome to the Tesla Model Website project, a web development project that showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive website for the Tesla Model cars. In this project, I aimed to recreate the design and functionality of the official Tesla website by implementing the basic features such as the homepage, vehicle pages, and a contact page. Through this project, I hope to demonstrate my skills in web development and provide a seamless user experience for visitors to the site.
